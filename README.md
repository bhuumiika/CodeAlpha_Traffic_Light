# Traffic Lights Simulation

This is a simple traffic lights simulation program written in C++. It simulates the behavior of traffic lights at a junction.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
3. Run the compiled executable.

## Features

- Simulates the changing of traffic lights from red to green to yellow and back to red.
- Includes logic for managing the timing of each light phase.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler
- Standard C++ libraries

## Acknowledgments

- This project was inspired by the need to understand the logic behind traffic lights control systems.
